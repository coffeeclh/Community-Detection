### Community Detection via Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN)

**Introduction:**

Aim to solve community detection problem via a semi-supervised and data driven algorithm: GCN. Take the network graph as input and predict which group each node belongs to. 

**Data:**

We applied GCN in three network datasets: email-Eu-core network, Coras and
Youtube Social Network. They can be downloaded through website below.

* Cora Dataset

* Youtube Social Network

**Result:**

We ran our GCN model in three datasets and compare results with traditional unsupervised clustering method: spectral cluster as baseline. Results are shown below.
